# Weather App Project

This project is part of The Odin Project: JavaScript Full Stack Developer path.

Helped me sharp my JavaScript skills by applying Promises in combination with async/await to fetch data and work with APIs. In this case I used Open Weather and Pexels APIs.

In addition, went a step further to get more comfortable with SASS/SCSS.
